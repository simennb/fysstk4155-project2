# FYS-STK4155: Project 2
An investigation into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and feed-forward neural networks (FFNN). This project aims to study how SGD and FFNN can be used for both regression and classification problems. The data sets used is the Franke function as well as the MNIST data set available the Scikit-Learn python package.

## Report
The report for this project can be found [here.](https://github.com/simennb/fysstk4155-project2/blob/main/report/project2.pdf)

## Usage
### Regression:
The file `task_a.py` performs the analysis with SGD

The file `task_b.py` performs the analysis with FFNN
### Classification:
The file `task_d.py` performs the analysis with SGD

The file `task_e.py` performs the analysis with FFNN

## Benchmarks
A set of benchmark results can be found in the benchmarks folder, with one file corresponding to each of the main programs of the project.
